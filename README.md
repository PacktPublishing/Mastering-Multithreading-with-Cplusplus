# Mastering Multithreading with C++ [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Multithreading with C++ [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-multithreading-c-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788836210), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers achieve concurrency. This video will teach you the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C++.Divided into three modules, we start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions. Weâ€™ll also learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++ since the 2011 revision, synchronization, and communication between threads.
